# Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which you'll need to install the project's dependencies.
  - Windows: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
  - macOS/Linux: You can install Node.js via a package manager like Homebrew for macOS (brew install node) or using a Node version manager like nvm.

# Instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
## 1. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/hakkajoe/Form-Builder.git
```

## 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:

```
cd Form-Builder
```

## 3. Install the Dependencies
Use npm to install the required dependencies for the project:

```
npm install
```
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary packages.

## 4. Run the Development Server
Start the React development server:

```
npm start
```
Windows: This will open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.
macOS/Linux: The same as Windows, the app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
The development server supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make to the code will be reflected in the browser without needing to restart the server.
